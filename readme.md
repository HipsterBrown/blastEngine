#BlockBlaster Bootstrap!

This is the start of a super basic canvas game structure/framework/boilerplate-bootstrappy thing, and the result of the bits and pieces of the last few projects I've worked on. The example I've used as a base is a Galaga-style space shooter, but really you could take this in any direction. 

Fork it and use this as a starter for your own bigger and better things!

Check out the demo [here](http://greypants.github.com/blockblaster-bootstrap/).
