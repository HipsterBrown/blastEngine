#Blockblaster Boilerplate!

This is the start of a super basic canvas game structure/framework/boilerplate-bootstrappy thing, and the result of the bits and pieces of the last few projects I've worked on. It's purpose is to create a re-usable starting point for future canvas projects. The example I've used as a base is a basic Galaga-style space shooter, but you should fork it and use this as a starter for your own bigger and better things!

This project is very much in flux, and may change quite a bit in the coming days.
